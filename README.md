# qlik-venn

A venn diagram extension for Qlik Sense. This extension leverages the power of Qlik Sense engine's to make all the set calculations. It is thus very fast, relyable and consistent with other Qlik Sense KPIs.

# How to use

The first dimension represents the circles. Each value of the first dimension will be a different circle (max = 8). It could for instance be the Products dimension.

The second dimension represents what is counted. It is for instance the Customers dimension.

Each circle represents the number of customers for each product.

The space where the areas merge represents the customers that bought the two products.

It is possible to select the customers that bought one product or the two products, but also (and more interestingly) that bought one product only, and not the other one.

# Warning

This uses the low level engine RPC Qlik Sense API. It might thus break in future versions
